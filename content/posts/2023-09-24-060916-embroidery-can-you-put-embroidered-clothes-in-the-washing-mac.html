<p>Are you wondering if you can put embroidered clothes in the washing machine? Well, the answer is yes, you can! But, before you do, there are a few things you should know. </p>

<p>First of all, <b>can you put embroidered clothes in the washing machine?</b> Yes, you can! But, you should always check the care label first. If the care label says “hand wash only”, then you should not put it in the washing machine. If the care label says “machine washable”, then you can put it in the washing machine. </p>

<p>When you do put embroidered clothes in the washing machine, you should always use a gentle cycle and cold water. Hot water can cause the embroidery to shrink and fade. You should also use a mild detergent and avoid using bleach. If you are washing a delicate item, you should use a mesh laundry bag to protect it. </p>

<p>Finally, when it comes to drying embroidered clothes, you should always air dry them. The heat from the dryer can cause the embroidery to shrink and fade. If you must use a dryer, use the lowest heat setting and remove the item from the dryer as soon as it is dry. </p>

<p>So, there you have it! You can put embroidered clothes in the washing machine, but you should always check the care label first and use a gentle cycle and cold water. And, when it comes to drying, always air dry the item. </p>
