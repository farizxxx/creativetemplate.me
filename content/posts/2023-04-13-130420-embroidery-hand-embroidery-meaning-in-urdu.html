Hand embroidery is often used to decorate clothing, accessories, and home décor items. It can also be used to create beautiful works of art.</p>

<p>Kashida Kari is a popular form of embroidery in Pakistan and India. It is often used to embellish traditional clothing, such as shalwar kameez and saris. The designs are usually intricate and colorful, and can include motifs such as flowers, birds, and geometric shapes. The embroidery is usually done in silk, cotton, or wool thread, and can be done in a variety of stitches, such as chain stitch, satin stitch, and French knot. The embroidery is usually done on a fabric backing, such as muslin or canvas.</p>
